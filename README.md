In this project I designed and developed a low poly idle fishing mobile game to culminate my learning about different mobile specific development techniques including monetization & retention in order to create a mobile game that would have the highest chance of success within the saturated and competitive mobile market. 

This project was completed in the first & second semesters of my 'Mobile Games Development' module in the final year of my 'Computer Games Development' degree at Staffordshire University.

## Features
- Touch controls
- Core gameplay loop
- Optimal Frame rate for mobile
- Appropriate UI
- Monetisation Strategy
- Analytics
- Data Persistence
- In-App Purchases
- Retention Mechanics
- Adjustable audio
- Reward advertisments


## Goals & Requirements
To create design documentation giving consideration to the monetisation strategy, retention techniques, artistic style, required assets, etc and including wireframes and mockups of the appplication. 

This documentation would then be used to develop a game that has a suitable menu structure and menu transitions to start the game using appropriate input methods for mobile, has a functional game which is playable on a mobile device and has consideration to a monetization strategy.


## Project Thinking
I decided to create an idle game with simplistic controls as these games have a high chance of success within the mobile market especially when combined with appropriate UI, a pleasurable art style and effective monetisation & retention methods.


## Key Learnings
This project was a deep exploration into mobile games developemnt and the specific considerations that need to be made for the mobile platform.

- Mobile specific games development techniques
- Developing a product using a Planning first philosophy
- Creating wireframes & mockups
- Monetization techniques including Paid, Free & Freemium
- Retention techniques e.g. Daily rewards
- Optimsiation using the Unity Profiler
- Implementing design patterns
- Using analytics

Overall, this was a very beneficial project during my final year that allowed me to research explore mobile specific games development techniques and strategeies as well as explore taking a game through the full development process including design, developmnet, and optimsiation ready for release.
